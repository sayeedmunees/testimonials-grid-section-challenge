## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In addition to utilizing Flexbox, I also explored the power of media queries to further enhance the responsiveness of my web design across various devices. Media queries allowed me to tailor specific CSS rules based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, and orientation. Here's an example showcasing the use of flexbox and media queries:

```css

@media (min-width: 576px) {
   .header {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    position: relative;
    z-index: 3;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7) - Got this challenge from Frontend Mentor, along with workfiles like required designs, icons and other files.

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Here's another useful resourse, which is the MDN documentation itself. It helped me to find, understand and use code snipped that i didn't knew before.
